## Prerequisites
Firstly, we need to import a few python libraries which will help us to analyse and scrape the data. These will also enable us to clean, organize, and maniplulate the data according to our needs.<br>
These libraries are-<br>
- ***Datascience library*** - for creating the tables and performing related functions
- ***requests*** - to send and fetch requests from the browser 
- ***json*** - to convert the fetched requests to readable dictionary formats 
- ***numpy,pandas,matplotlib*** - to manipulate, clean and visualize the data    
- ***BeautifulSoup*** - to scrape the web
  

## Introduction

## Global Pricing Overview
We used the BeautifulSoup library and scraped the browser to find out the current global prices of the latest model of iphone and this is what we found -<br>

<br>
As we can see from the table, the prices scraped from the web, might not always clean so we had to implemet some functions to clean the data, and after a lot of cleaning and brushing and wiping, we were able to obtain a table which was in local currencies ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br>

### So how do we standardize these local currencies?
<br>
Thats when APIs help us!
<br>
We used currency exchange APIs to obtain the conversion rates with CAD $ as the base currencey,<br>

so all the prices we see now one will be in CAD$ , RIGHT??? NO , not so easily <br>

<br>
Turns out, the table we scraped for the prices, does not tell the currency codes but only the country. <br>
So we scraped an additional table from wikipedia, which contained the code, for the country and corresponding name <br>

Now, we just need to join the tables of echange rates and country codes to get the resulting <br>

Then finally we did manage to get the final table which contained values for iphone in different countries represented in CAD $ for the ease of things.
